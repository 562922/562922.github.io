    <h1>Types of webpages/websites.</h1>
    <p>There are many different types off websites and webpages. But first lets get a baseline 
        understanding of the differenceses between a website and a webpage.</p>
    <p>A webpage is a single document accessable via the internet. This isn't used much because 
        of it's simplicity, but it's where we will be starting. A website on the other hand is 
        a collection of webpages that can be accessed under a single domain. This is used much 
        more widely on the internet and is what we will be working up to. A website often includes 
        a stylesheet and some javascript.</p>
    <p>There are two main types of websites: Static and Dynamic. A static website is one that 
        doesn't change based on user input. This is the most basic type of website and is what 
        we will be starting with. A dynamic website on the other hand is one that can change 
        based on user input. This is a more advanced type of website and often includes a 
        database to store user information.</p>
